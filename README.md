# Frequency_Generator_For_Healing


This is a adjustable frequency generator using an Teensy 4.1 development board's built in DSP library. It produces precise audio frequencies for all sorts of health needs, such as sleeping, meditating, or even studying. The device also offers a touchscreen, customizable frequency selection, waveform generation. I'm developing a feature to custom draw a waveform on the touchscreen to hear what sound it produces. All electronics are neatly housed in a custom-designed 3D-printed enclosure.

I made this project to because I love music and sound, and wanted to make a project dedicated to my music passion that is useful at the same time. It is particularly helpful for personal meditation, sound therapy, or group sessions in remote locations.
